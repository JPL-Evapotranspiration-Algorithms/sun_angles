def SZA_deg_from_lat_dec_hour(latitude: np.ndarray, solar_dec_deg: np.ndarray, hour: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    This function calculates the solar zenith angle (SZA) given the latitude, solar declination, and solar time. 
    The SZA is the angle between the zenith and the center of the sun's disc. The zenith is the point on the celestial 
    sphere directly above a specific location on the earth's surface.

    The calculation is based on the formula:
    cos(SZA) = sin(latitude) * sin(solar declination) + cos(latitude) * cos(solar declination) * cos(hour angle)

    The function has been validated against the MOD07 product, with the SZA calculated by this function matching 
    the SZA provided by MOD07 to within 0.4 degrees.

    Parameters:
    :param latitude: Latitude of the location in degrees. Ranges from -90 (South Pole) to 90 (North Pole).
    :param solar_dec_deg: Solar declination in degrees. It is the tilt of the Earth's axis relative to the sun and varies throughout the year.
    :param hour: Solar time in hours. It is the time based on the position of the sun in the sky, and varies throughout the day from 0 to 24.

    Returns:
    :return: Solar zenith angle in degrees. Ranges from 0 (sun directly overhead) to 90 (sun on the horizon).
